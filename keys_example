# A line is a comment if it begins with '#'
#
# Syntax is:
#    action keydef
# Where action is up, down, left, right, stop, pause or exit, and keydef is
# either a typable character within surrounded by ''s, a raw number that
# curses getch() can handle or any of <return>, <tab>, <esc>, <space>, <enter>,
# <down>, <up>, <left>, <right>, <home>, <backspace>, <del>, <ins>, <pgdn>,
# <pgup> or <end>. Note that you can't use ' '. Instead, use <space>.
#
# By default lwrace looks in "~/.lwrace/keys" for keydefs. You can also use
# the -k switch to specify keyfile.
